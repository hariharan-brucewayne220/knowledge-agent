# KnowAgent Research Assistant

## 🎯 Project Overview
Implementation of KnowAgent (2024) for intelligent research assistance with knowledge-augmented planning.

## 🧠 Core Concept
Instead of letting LLM agents randomly try actions, KnowAgent:
1. Checks a knowledge base for valid actions
2. Creates validated plans
3. Executes only safe, logical sequences
